👋 Hi there, I'm a Computer Vision Scientist! 🚀
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate computer vision scientist at Veridium ID in Oxford, where I work on cutting-edge technology to push the boundaries of AI and computer vision.

🎓 I completed my MS in Big Data Science with Distinction from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), where I honed my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and data science.

🔬 Previously, I had the pleasure of collaborating as a deep learning research collaborator at Steinberg Media Technologies in London, where I delved into the fascinating world of audio processing and synthesis using advanced deep learning techniques.

💼 My professional journey also includes experience as a data scientist at The Buttonwood Tree and a machine learning engineer at Mass Technologies, where I worked on various data-driven projects, solving real-world problems using machine learning and AI.

🌐 As the former president of DIPEx, I led a group of like-minded individuals passionate about technlogy, fostering a thriving community for learning and collaboration.

✨ I'm always eager to connect, collaborate, and learn from others in the field. Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories to see some of the exciting projects I've been working on! Let's make the world a smarter place together! 🌟
